The two types of pulmonary agents are central and peripheral. Central pulmonary agents, for example, ammonia, are water soluble irritants that injure the upper airways. Peripheral pulmonary agents, for example, phosgene, NOx, and PFIB, are slightly water soluble irritants that injure the alveolar-capillary membranes.
